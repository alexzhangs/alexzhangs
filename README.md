### Hi there 👋  I'm Alex. 

* I am currently working as a full-stack web developer and also a cloud architect in freelancing.
* I design solid and practical data models, write high-performance SQL and complex queries, plus do the administration and tuning tasks.
* I design solid RESTful APIs. I am a lover of hypermedia and implemented the [Siren specification](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren) for Django and Django-Rest-Framework.
* I was working as a core developer of the early IBM cloud product team helping to [get DB2 ready in the cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/dbaas).
* I am an AWS cloud user since 2011. I maintain over 20 [related open source projects](https://github.com/alexzhangs?tab=repositories&q=aws).
* I am used to programming with Python(see [one of my recent works](https://github.com/alexzhangs/shadowsocks-manager)), but not afraid of learning anything new.
* I write reusable Shellcode, I am the founder of the open-source project [xsh](https://github.com/alexzhangs/xsh).
* I adopt productivity processes and tools for small businesses/teams, such as CI/CD, Google Apps, LDAP, Jira/Confluence, Slack.
* Productivity relies on tools, here are some of them I love(d): Emacs/vi, PL/SQL Developer, PowerDesigner, Rational Rose, BeyondCompare, Jazz, RTC, PyCharm, DbVisualizer, Slack, Stackoverflow, [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/github/alexzhangs), Coverage, [codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/alexzhangs), etc.
* I hate to repeat myself, have a look at [this project to understand me](https://github.com/alexzhangs/aws-cfn-vpn).
* I started [my very first personal website](https://web.archive.org/web/20050323232529/http://aiview.com:80/) <sup>[❶](#1)</sup> <sup>[❷](#2)</sup> in 1999, and [my first blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20100325202431/http://www.aiview.com:80/) <sup>[❶](#1)</sup> <sup>[❷](#2)</sup> (powered by Movable Type on dreamhost.com) in 2006, now I'm setting [my new blog](https://alexzhangs.github.io) up with Github Pages.
* I started to use Gentoo Linux in 2006 as my desktop operating system for both work and personal life and wrote [a series of study notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20110303042624/http://www.aiview.com/linux/#begin-of-page) <sup>[❶](#1)</sup> <sup>[❷](#2)</sup> for the hard time back then. I switched to Mac in 2012.
* I speak Chinese, use English during work, and I am learning Japanese now.
* I love traveling, hiking, and photography. I'm a fan of Leica RangeFinder Cameras, yes! The vintage film cameras, made of such durable stuff.
* I am a fan of electronics and amateur radio. I am used to playing with my fun equipment in my small lab.
