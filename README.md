# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Alex. 

* I am currently working as a full-stack web developer and also a cloud architect in freelancing.
* I keep the repositores that I forked in a separate organization [alexforks](https://github.com/alexforks).
* I speak Chinese, use English during work, and I am learning Japanese now.

## ðŸ›¸ Hobbies

* I love traveling, hiking, and photography. I'm a fan of Leica RangeFinder Cameras, yes! The vintage film cameras, made of such durable stuff.
* I am a fan of electronics and amateur radio. I am used to playing with my fun equipment in my small workshop.
