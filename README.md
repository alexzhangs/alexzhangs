### Hi there üëã  I'm Alex. 

* I am currently working as a full-stack web developer and also a cloud architect in freelancing.
* I started [my very first personal website](https://web.archive.org/web/20050323232529/http://aiview.com:80/) <sup>[‚ù∂](#1)</sup> <sup>[‚ù∑](#2)</sup> in 1999, and [my first blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20100325202431/http://www.aiview.com:80/) <sup>[‚ù∂](#1)</sup> <sup>[‚ù∑](#2)</sup> (powered by Movable Type on dreamhost.com) in 2006, now I'm setting [my new blog](https://alexzhangs.github.io) up with Github Pages.
* I speak Chinese, use English during work, and I am learning Japanese now.
* I love traveling, hiking, and photography. I'm a fan of Leica RangeFinder Cameras, yes! The vintage film cameras, made of such durable stuff.
* I am a fan of electronics and amateur radio. I am used to playing with my fun equipment in my small workshop.
